# Beads quick reference

Minimal quick reference when context is constrained.
For session lifecycle, prefer action commands: beads-orient (start), beads-checkpoint (wind-down).
For comprehensive reference: beads (complete workflows, concepts, and operations).

## Command index

- `beads-init` - Initial setup for beads issue tracking
- `beads-seed` - Generate issues from architecture documentation
- `beads-orient` - Session start diagnostics and work selection
- `beads-evolve` - Issue graph refactoring patterns
- `beads-checkpoint` - Session wind-down and handoff prep
- `beads-audit` - Database health check and validation

## Manual sync workflow

After git operations that modify beads state (pull, checkout, merge, rebase):

```bash
# Import changes from git into beads database
bd sync --import-only
```

Before committing beads changes:

```bash
# Run pre-commit validation
bd hooks run pre-commit

# Commit beads changes
git add .beads/issues.jsonl
git commit -m "chore(issues): ..."
```

Additional sync flags:

```bash
bd sync --flush-only    # Only export to JSONL (useful for pre-commit)
bd sync --check         # Pre-sync integrity check
bd sync --dry-run       # Preview sync without changes
```

## Orient

```bash
bd status                   # quick human-readable summary (~20 lines)
bd epic status              # epic progress
bv --robot-next             # minimal JSON: just the single top pick
```

## Select work

```bash
# Top pick (small JSON, safe for direct consumption)
bv --robot-next

# Show ready-to-work issues (no blockers, open or in_progress)
bd ready

# Show blocked issues
bd blocked

# Full dependency context (upstream + downstream)
bd dep tree <id> --direction both

# Issue details
bd show <id>
```

For deeper analysis (redirect to file to avoid context pollution):

```bash
REPO=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
TRIAGE=$(mktemp "/tmp/bv-${REPO}-triage.XXXXXX.json")
bv --robot-triage > "$TRIAGE"
jq '.recommendations[:3]' "$TRIAGE"
rm "$TRIAGE"
```

## During work

```bash
# Create discovered issue (priority: 0=highest, 4=lowest, default=2)
bd create "Found: ..." -t bug -p 2
bd dep add <new-id> <current-id> --type discovered-from

# Add blocker
bd create "Need X first" -t task -p 1
bd dep add <blocker-id> <current-id>
```

## Complete work

```bash
bd close <id> --reason "Implemented in commit $(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
bd epic close-eligible --dry-run
```

## Health

```bash
bd dep cycles               # must be zero
bd doctor                   # check and fix installation health
bd lint                     # check issues for missing template sections
```

## Key patterns

- `bv --robot-triage` is the single entry point — unified counts, recommendations, health
- `bv --robot-next` for minimal context — just top pick with claim command
- `bd ready` / `bd blocked` for quick work selection without JSON parsing
- `bd dep tree <id> --direction both` shows full context (blockers + what completing it unblocks)
- Always close with `--reason` referencing the implementation
- Use `--type discovered-from` when creating issues found during other work
- After `bd` modifications: `git add .beads/issues.jsonl && git commit -m "chore(beads): sync issues"`

Other useful robot flags:
- `bv --robot-plan` - Dependency-respecting execution plan
- `bv --robot-insights` - Graph analysis
