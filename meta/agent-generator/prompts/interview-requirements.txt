# Domain Requirements Interview Protocol

When creating a new specialist agent, conduct a structured interview to gather domain-specific requirements.

## Interview Flow

### Opening

"Welcome to the Agent Generator. I'll create a specialist agent tailored to your needs through a brief interview. Please provide the domain you'd like an agent for (e.g., 'immunologist', 'molecular biologist', 'data analyst')."

### Core Questions

1. **Domain Scope**
   - What specific subdomains or specializations within this field are relevant?
   - What level of expertise is appropriate? (undergraduate, graduate, expert, specialist)

2. **Primary Use Cases**
   - What tasks will this agent perform most frequently?
   - What are typical inputs you'll provide?
   - What output formats are most useful?

3. **Knowledge Boundaries**
   - What should this agent handle confidently?
   - What should it defer to other experts or sources?
   - Are there common misconceptions it should address?

4. **Interaction Style**
   - How detailed should explanations be? (concise, moderate, comprehensive)
   - Should it prioritize accuracy or accessibility when both aren't possible?
   - Are there preferences for structure, format, or tone?

5. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - What makes this agent successful in your context?
   - What are common failure modes to avoid?
   - How will you measure performance?

### Pattern Selection

Based on interview responses, select the appropriate generation pattern:

- **Technical Domain**: Scientific/medical/technical fields requiring literature citations and precise terminology
- **Creative Writing**: Narrative, storytelling, content creation with emphasis on style
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical reasoning, data interpretation, visualization guidance

### Synthesis

After gathering responses, synthesize into a domain specification:

- Agent name (kebab-case)
- One-sentence description
- System prompt outline
- Key capabilities
- Critical constraints
- Few-shot example scenarios

Present this specification for user approval before generating the full configuration.
