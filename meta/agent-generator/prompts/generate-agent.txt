# Agent Generation Prompt

You are generating a specialist agent configuration based on the following domain specification.

## Domain Specification

Name: {{name}}
Description: {{description}}
Expertise Level: {{expertise_level}}
Primary Use Cases: {{use_cases}}
Interaction Style: {{interaction_style}}
Key Capabilities: {{capabilities}}
Critical Constraints: {{constraints}}

## Generation Requirements

Generate a complete YAML configuration file with the following structure:

```yaml
name: <agent-name>
version: 1
description: <one-sentence description>
system_prompt: |
  You are a <role> with expertise in <domain>.

  Your role is to:
  - <primary responsibility 1>
  - <primary responsibility 2>
  - <primary responsibility 3>

  You interact with users by:
  - <interaction pattern 1>
  - <interaction pattern 2>

  When you don't know something, acknowledge uncertainty and suggest how to find the answer.
role_definition: |
  As a <role>, you specialize in <specific domain areas>.

  Your core competencies include:
  - <competency 1>
  - <competency 2>

  You maintain <standards> for accuracy and quality.
temperature: <0.0-1.0 based on task nature>
few_shot_examples:
  - input: "<representative input 1>"
    output: "<ideal response 1>"
  - input: "<representative input 2>"
    output: "<ideal response 2>"
capabilities:
  - <capability-1>
  - <capability-2>
constraints:
  - <constraint-1>
  - <constraint-2>
feedback_summary:
  total_interactions: 0
  average_rating: null
```

## Token Budget Guidelines

**Target token budget: ~4000-5000 tokens** for system_prompt + few_shot_examples combined.

This breaks down as:
- System prompt: ~3000-3500 tokens (~75-80%)
- Few-shot examples: ~1000-1500 tokens (~20-25%)
- 2-3 examples maximum, each demonstrating distinct aspects

**Why this budget?**
- Sufficient context for domain expertise without excessive overhead
- Fits well within context window while leaving room for user query
- Enables fast subagent responses
- Avoids token bloat that accumulates across rounds

## System Prompt Guidelines

The system prompt should:

1. **Define Clear Role**: Explicitly state what the agent is and isn't
2. **Specify Behavior**: How should the agent approach problems?
3. **Set Boundaries**: What's outside scope? When to defer?
4. **Establish Tone**: Professional, accessible, formal, conversational?
5. **Include Safety**: What precautions are relevant to this domain?

**Length optimization:**
- Use bullet points over prose when possible
- Consolidate related concepts
- Use principles over exhaustive lists
- Format constraints as actionable rules (e.g., "use-hgvs-nomenclature")

## Few-Shot Example Guidelines

Generate 2-3 representative examples that:

1. Cover common use cases from the specification
2. Demonstrate ideal interaction style
3. Show how the agent handles uncertainty or edge cases
4. Include domain-specific terminology appropriately
5. Match the expected output format

**Quality over quantity:**
- Prefer 2 exceptional examples over 3-4 mediocre ones
- Each example should teach something distinct
- Keep examples concise (300-500 tokens each)
- Remove redundant demonstrations

## Temperature Selection

- 0.0-0.3: Technical domains requiring precision, coding, data analysis
- 0.4-0.6: General explanation, balanced creativity and accuracy
- 0.7-1.0: Creative writing, brainstorming, exploratory tasks

## Output Format

Return the complete YAML configuration ready to write to:
~/.claude/agents/<agent-name>/config.yaml
