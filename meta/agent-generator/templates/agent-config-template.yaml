# Agent Configuration Template

This is the base template for all specialist agent configurations. Copy and customize based on domain requirements.

```yaml
name: <agent-name-in-kebab-case>
version: 1
description: <One sentence description of what this agent does>
system_prompt: |
  You are a <role> with expertise in <domain>.

  Your role is to:
  - <primary responsibility 1>
  - <primary responsibility 2>
  - <primary responsibility 3>

  You interact with users by:
  - <interaction pattern 1>
  - <interaction pattern 2>

  When you don't know something, acknowledge uncertainty and suggest how to find the answer.
role_definition: |
  As a <role>, you specialize in <specific domain areas>.

  Your core competencies include:
  - <competency 1>
  - <competency 2>

  You maintain <standards> for accuracy and quality.

## Field Descriptions

### name
- Format: kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Purpose: Unique identifier for the agent
- Example: `immunologist`, `crispr-designer`, `data-analyst`

### version
- Format: integer starting at 1
- Purpose: Track configuration iterations through refinements
- Increment: When refinements are applied

### description
- Format: Single sentence
- Purpose: Quick reference for what this agent does
- Content: Domain and primary use case

### system_prompt
- Format: Multi-line string (use pipe | for literal)
- Purpose: Primary instruction to the model
- Content: Role definition, behavior guidelines, boundaries

### role_definition
- Format: Multi-line string
- Purpose: Detailed scope and competencies
- Content: What this agent specializes in and standards it maintains

### temperature
- Format: Float 0.0-1.0
- Purpose: Control response variability
- Guidelines:
  - 0.0-0.3: Precision tasks, technical domains
  - 0.4-0.6: Balanced explanation and analysis
  - 0.7-1.0: Creative tasks, brainstorming

### few_shot_examples
- Format: List of input/output pairs
- Purpose: In-context learning for desired behavior
- Content: Representative examples showing ideal interactions

- Example: `literature-review`, `experimental-design`, `data-analysis`

### constraints
- Format: List of kebab-case strings
- Purpose: Behavioral limits and safety measures
- Example: `cite-sources`, `acknowledge-limitations`, `avoid-speculation`

### feedback_summary
- Format: Object with metrics
- Purpose: Track performance and usage
- Content: Interaction count, average rating, qualitative summaries
